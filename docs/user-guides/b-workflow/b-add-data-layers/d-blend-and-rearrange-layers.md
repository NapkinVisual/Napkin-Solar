  <b>There are three different ways to blend layers: Normal, Additive, and Subtractive.</b>

## Normal Blending
Normal layer blending does not alter the color values of overlapping data points.

## Additive Blending
Additive blending adds the color values for overlapping data points. It makes layers, and particularly areas of high density, easier to visualize on a dark-colored map.

## Subtractive Blending
Subtractive layer blending does not alter the color values of overlapping data points.
